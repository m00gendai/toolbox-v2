### What is this repository for? ###

This is an intranet information hub, basically a collection of links and applets related to the work place.
It is completely serverless, meaning it lives as a simple collection of HTML, JS and CSS files on a harddrive. This is due to constraints and requirements at the workplace.
It uses JSON as "databases" mainly, and heavily relies on LocalStorage and file URI operations to persistently save and retrieve data.

Python was used to create the software that converts CSV files into customized JSON files since data delivery is alsmost exclusively Excel.
