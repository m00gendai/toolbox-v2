### What is this repository for? ###

This is an intranet information hub, basically a collection of links and applets related to the work place.

It is built with server independence in mind, hence no JS modules.
It mainly uses JSON format as a "database" where applicable.

Python was used to create the software that converts CSV files into customized JSON files since data delivery is alsmost exclusively Excel.

### How do I get set up? ###

The toolbox makes use of the following libraries:

* lodash
* dragula

Basic maintenance in the sense of adding/removing/changing Home Page Tiles (links to applets/websites) and/or AIP Tiles (links to electronic AIPs) requires only amendments in the respective JS files, the rest happens automatically.

### Contribution guidelines ###

### Who do I talk to? ###
